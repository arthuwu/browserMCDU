Welcome to browserMCDU!

This is supposed to be a semi-realistic simulation of a Airbus A320 family's Honeywell MCDU with pygame. 
This project is heavily work in progress - nothing is stable.

The plan is for me to get some sort of WASM thing going in order to implment this all on a webpage but this is looking rather dim right now.
